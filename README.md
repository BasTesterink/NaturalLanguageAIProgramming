# NaturalLanguageAIProgramming
Some experimental proof-of-concept code for moving towards natural language programming of AI. The core idea is to translate written/spoken natural language to an efficient decision tree. The provided demo shows a simple bit of knowledge about picking an action in a game setting. I've only tested it with SWI-Prolog. To run the demo: install SWI-Prolog, clone this project in a folder, run SWI-Prolog and load 'main.pl' (use "[main]"). The demo automatically loads the AI.txt specification and builds a decision tree. An expansion of the specification, with a rest action, is specified in AIWithRest.txt. To call it, use "main('AIWithRest.txt')." in SWI-Prolog, after "main.pl" is loaded. I'm working on a full adaptation for a conversational interface and KeeperRL.
